                The aim of Fragment n°1: 9 liminal meters is twofold. First, it
                invites the viewer to experience an element of cinematic
                language recurrent in suspense films in an immersive aspect. It
                also presents itself as a testimony of a shooting/performance in
                a 9 meter corridor, at a speed of about 18 cm per minute.<br />
                Throughout the shooting, there is a sort of rite of passage
                where there camera (the viewer) is caught between two unknowns;
                what is behind - out of the back field - and what is approaching
                - the room plunged in the dark. - The camera (the viewer) thus
                becomes the present caught between the past and the future, that
                threshold that is constantly renewed throughout the progress.<br />
                The piece requires a physical and temporal commitment from the
                spectator. The slowness facing the capacity of concentration and
                there will of implication of the latter, without which the
                reading of this piece is not possible.
