                Abandoned in 1966 and reputed to be haunted, the herring factory
                in Hjalteyri, located in the north of Iceland, is today
                partially transformed into an art center. Initially composed for
                this center and to be heard in this same place, <i>Glámur</i> is
                inscribed in this abandonment, in these deserted places, in the
                history of this small fishing village of about 46
                inhabitants.<br />
                This sound piece calls upon the <i>Saga of Grettir</i>, and is
                set in the region where the main character finds himself cursed
                after a fight with a ghost, Glámur. It reveals the sounds and
                sonorities of the ruined spaces, making them emerge as invisible
                elements whose presence comes to haunt and inhabit the place at
                times.<br />
                Today ex-situ, <i>Glámur</i> has been rethought in the form of a
                score so that it fits into the continuity of the ruin of the
                factory from which it originates, that it resists in time by
                reproducing itself.
