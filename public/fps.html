                FPS (Film Phase Screen) 24/25 is a project that explores the
                intersection between analog film and digital telecine. The
                project focuses on the subtle, fleeting essence that "flies
                away" when one medium switches to another. It highlights this
                volatile, imperceptible element, which is only revealed by the
                direct confrontation of film and telecine.<br />
                The technique employed involves a deliberate temporal shift in
                shutter and projector rhythms between analog film and digital
                telecine. The film strip runs continuously at a constant speed
                of around 10 cm/s, equivalent to 24 frames per second. However,
                the mechanism for projecting one frame after another has been
                eliminated, allowing uninterrupted scrolling without
                intermittent shuttering. By capturing this continuous projection
                on the camera, the camera shutter, operating at 25 fps,
                reproduces the frame-by-frame display process. The difference in
                speed between the two mechanisms results in a regular image
                shift or framing effect.<br />
                The object of the project is a continuous, illegible film,
                embodying blurred, elusive information. It reflects the paradox
                of the slow, programmed disappearance of the film medium in
                favor of digital convenience. The film medium has inherent
                disadvantages compared to the ease of digital technology, and
                also carries a high risk of damage or deterioration.<br />
                The subject of the film itself is of lesser value, as it is a
                personal film made at home. However, it serves as testimony to a
                bygone practice and way of life, raising historical and
                archaeological questions in today's context. As a found film, it
                invokes the notion of archaeology as a science that destroys its
                own study material. In this installation, where the film image
                becomes invisible due to saturation, the action of telecine can
                be compared to an excavation, revealing the hidden element
                through the filter of a new shutter.<br />
                FPS (Film Phase Screen) 24/25, captures the essence of fleeting
                moments, explores the interplay of different temporal modalities
                and raises questions about the transition from analog to
                digital. It invites viewers to contemplate the impermanence of
                materials, the passage of time and the layers of meaning
                embedded in the act of preservation and transformation.<br />
