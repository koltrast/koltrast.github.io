        <h3>Film de Projecteur</h3>
        <img src="images/filmproj01.jpeg" />
        <p>
          This film - a tribute to Lettrist cinema and in particular that of
          Roland Sabatier - is a film governed by the life of the bulb, thus
          offering a definition of cinema made up of a space (that of the
          projection), of light (then of its absence) and of time (duration).<br />
          It is a film doomed to disappear, at the end of the projection, by the
          rupture of the filament of the bulb, but also in the long run
          following the progressive prohibition of production, in Europe, of
          incandescent lamps of which the halogen lamps are part.

        <p>
          At first glance, this edition presents a beam of light on a black
          background. If you look closely you can see objects, silhouettes,
          faces, landscapes... some clues offer the possibility to understand
          that these prints are photographs capturing the instant of an electron
          beam on the surface of a cathode ray screen. Thus revealing an image
          in three times: fantomatic, present and future.<br />
          As the pages scroll, the title appears, /Stalker/, revealing the
          origin of the images. Each of them represents a tiny fraction of a
          shot from Tarkovsky's film, echoing this element that only quotes
          itself without ever revealing itself.

        <h3>FPS (Film Phase Screen) 24/25</h3>
        <img src="images/fps_framecomp.jpg" />
        <p>
          FPS (Film Phase Screen) 24/25 is a project that explores the
          intersection between analog film and digital telecine. The project
          focuses on the subtle, fleeting essence that "flies away" when one
          medium switches to another. It highlights this volatile, imperceptible
          element, which is only revealed by the direct confrontation of film
          and telecine.<br />

          The technique employed involves a deliberate temporal shift in shutter
          and projector rhythms between analog film and digital telecine. The
          film strip runs continuously at a constant speed of around 10 cm/s,
          equivalent to 24 frames per second. However, the mechanism for
          projecting one frame after another has been eliminated, allowing
          uninterrupted scrolling without intermittent shuttering. By capturing
          this continuous projection on the camera, the camera shutter,
          operating at 25 fps, reproduces the frame-by-frame display process.
          The difference in speed between the two mechanisms results in a
          regular image shift or framing effect.<br />

          The object of the project is a continuous, illegible film, embodying
          blurred, elusive information. It reflects the paradox of the slow,
          programmed disappearance of the film medium in favor of digital
          convenience. The film medium has inherent disadvantages compared to
          the ease of digital technology, and also carries a high risk of damage
          or deterioration.<br />

          The subject of the film itself is of lesser value, as it is a personal
          film made at home. However, it serves as testimony to a bygone
          practice and way of life, raising historical and archaeological
          questions in today's context. As a found film, it invokes the notion
          of archaeology as a science that destroys its own study material. In
          this installation, where the film image becomes invisible due to
          saturation, the action of telecine can be compared to an excavation,
          revealing the hidden element through the filter of a new shutter.<br />

          FPS (Film Phase Screen) 24/25, captures the essence of fleeting
          moments, explores the interplay of different temporal modalities and
          raises questions about the transition from analog to digital. It
          invites viewers to contemplate the impermanence of materials, the
          passage of time and the layers of meaning embedded in the act of
          preservation and transformation.<br />

        <p>
          The aim of Fragment n°1: 9 liminal meters is twofold. First, it
          invites the viewer to experience an element of cinematic language
          recurrent in suspense films in an immersive aspect. It also presents
          itself as a testimony of a shooting/performance in a 9 meter corridor,
          at a speed of about 18 cm per minute.<br />
          Throughout the shooting, there is a sort of rite of passage where
          there camera (the viewer) is caught between two unknowns; what is
          behind - out of the back field - and what is approaching - the room
          plunged in the dark. - The camera (the viewer) thus becomes the
          present caught between the past and the future, that threshold that is
          constantly renewed throughout the progress.<br />
          The piece requires a physical and temporal commitment from the
          spectator. The slowness facing the capacity of concentration and there
          will of implication of the latter, without which the reading of this
          piece is not possible.

          A détournement and pastiche of Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and
          the Ugly, Endless West presents a temporal expansion, eternalizing a
          moment of suspense from the original film, to the point of making it
          unbearable and increasing the absurdity of the scene.<br />
          This endless film - it stops just before the shot - raises questions
          about relationships of expectation, both in the viewer's posture
          towards the film and in the desire for the denouement.

          Abandoned in 1966 and reputed to be haunted, the herring factory in
          Hjalteyri, located in the north of Iceland, is today partially
          transformed into an art center. Initially composed for this center and
          to be heard in this same place, <i>Glámur</i> is inscribed in this
          abandonment, in these deserted places, in the history of this small
          fishing village of about 46 inhabitants.<br />
          This sound piece calls upon the <i>Saga of Grettir</i>, and is set in
          the region where the main character finds himself cursed after a fight
          with a ghost, Glámur. It reveals the sounds and sonorities of the
          ruined spaces, making them emerge as invisible elements whose presence
          comes to haunt and inhabit the place at times.<br />
          Today ex-situ, <i>Glámur</i> has been rethought in the form of a score
          so that it fits into the continuity of the ruin of the factory from
          which it originates, that it resists in time by reproducing itself.

        <p>
          <i>Superproduction</i> stands out for its unique experimental
          approach, which consists of presenting only film production logos. The
          screening of this film takes place just before the screening of other
          films.<br />
          This unusual approach, which defies the spectator’s expectations of
          cinema, poses a fundamental question:
          <em>le film est-t-il déjà commencé ?</em> (<em
            >has the film already begun?</em
          >)<br />
          In effect, the start of the real film is merely postponed, which may
          seem confusing to viewers. However, this method offers an opportunity
          to explore the opening of films as a liminal space, situated between
          the beginning of the projection and the beginning of the film.

          The sun sets, the forest plunges little by little into darkness. This
          progressive blindness opens up an alternative perception; the image
          shifts towards the sound, leaving the latter only as a reference
          point. Experience of a forest whose veil only lets the invisible
          appear.

          Hi, I'm Aurélien Mt., I'm a multidisciplinary artist based in France.
          Mostly used to work with cinematographic materials, I'm fascinated
          with their time relations and phenomenology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my work I reflect on time and its modalities through the
          cinematographic and new media art. My plastic research explores the
          existing permeability between different constituent elements of
          cinema, photography and sound.<br />
          Computers always has been my main tools, recently I started learning
          to code to explore the world of generative art as a step in the
          modality of future.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the projects carried out within the collective
          Union Pragmatique approach a reflection on the playful as well as the
          place of the young artistic creation and the economy in which this
          last one is registered.
