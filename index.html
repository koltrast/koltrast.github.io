      <h3>Film de Projecteur</h3>
      <img src="images/filmproj01.jpeg">
      <p>
        This film - a tribute to Lettrist cinema and in particular that of Roland Sabatier - is a film governed by the life of the bulb, thus offering a definition of cinema made up of a space (that of the projection), of light (then of its absence) and of time (duration).<br>
        It is a film doomed to disappear, at the end of the projection, by the rupture of the filament of the bulb, but also in the long run following the progressive prohibition of production, in Europe, of incandescent lamps of which the halogen lamps are part.

      <h3>1/4000s 50Hz Stalker</h3>
      <img src="images/DSC_2975.jpg">
      <p>
        At first glance, this edition presents a beam of light on a black background. If you look closely you can see objects, silhouettes, faces, landscapes... some clues offer the possibility to understand that these prints are photographs capturing the instant of an electron beam on the surface of a cathode ray screen. Thus revealing an image in three times: fantomatic, present and future.<br>
        As the pages scroll, the title appears, /Stalker/, revealing the origin of the images. Each of them represents a tiny fraction of a shot from Tarkovsky's film, echoing this element that only quotes itself without ever revealing itself.

      <p>
        The aim of Fragment n°1: 9 liminal meters is twofold. First, it invites the viewer to experience an element of cinematic language recurrent in suspense films in an immersive aspect. It also presents itself as a testimony of a shooting/performance in a 9 meter corridor, at a speed of about 18 cm per minute.<br>
        Throughout the shooting, there is a sort of rite of passage where there camera (the viewer) is caught between two unknowns; what is behind - out of the back field - and what is approaching - the room plunged in the dark. - The camera (the viewer) thus becomes the present caught between the past and the future, that threshold that is constantly renewed throughout the progress.<br>
        The piece requires a physical and temporal commitment from the spectator. The slowness facing the capacity of concentration and there will of implication of the latter, without which the reading of this piece is not possible.

      <p>
        A détournement and pastiche of Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Endless West presents a temporal expansion, eternalizing a moment of suspense from the original film, to the point of making it unbearable and increasing the absurdity of the scene.<br>
        This endless film - it stops just before the shot - raises questions about relationships of expectation, both in the viewer's posture towards the film and in the desire for the denouement.

        Abandoned in 1966 and reputed to be haunted, the herring factory in Hjalteyri, located in the north of Iceland, is today partially transformed into an art center. Initially composed for this center and to be heard in this same place, <i>Glámur</i> is inscribed in this abandonment, in these deserted places, in the history of this small fishing village of about 46 inhabitants.<br>
        This sound piece calls upon the <i>Saga of Grettir</i>, and is set in the region where the main character finds himself cursed after a fight with a ghost, Glámur. It reveals the sounds and sonorities of the ruined spaces, making them emerge as invisible elements whose presence comes to haunt and inhabit the place at times.<br>
        Today ex-situ, <i>Glámur</i> has been rethought in the form of a score so that it fits into the continuity of the ruin of the factory from which it originates, that it resists in time by reproducing itself.

        The sun sets, the forest plunges little by little into darkness. This progressive blindness opens up an alternative perception; the image shifts towards the sound, leaving the latter only as a reference point. Experience of a forest whose veil only lets the invisible appear.

        Hi, I'm Aurélien Mt., I'm a multidisciplinary artist based in France. Mostly used to work with cinematographic materials, I'm fascinated with their time relations and phenomenology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my work I reflect on time and its modalities through the cinematographic and new media art. My plastic research explores the existing permeability between different constituent elements of cinema, photography and sound.<br>
        Computers always has been my main tools, recently I started learning to code to explore the world of generative art as a step in the modality of future.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the projects carried out within the collective Union Pragmatique approach a reflection on the playful as well as the place of the young artistic creation and the economy in which this last one is registered.<br>
        I live and work in duo with visual artist Eunsoo Kim.
